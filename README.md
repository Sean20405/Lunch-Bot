# Lunch Bot
## Introduction
This project is a Line Bot that was developed during my high school years to streamline the lunch ordering process for my class. The bot records orders placed within a Line group and leverages Selenium to automatically navigate the school's lunch ordering system. Initially, it was hosted on Heroku. However, due to the cessation of Heroku's free tier and my graduation, the bot is no longer active.
